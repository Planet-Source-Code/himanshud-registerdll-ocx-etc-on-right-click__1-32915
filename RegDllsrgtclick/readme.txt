 This application can be used for associating files with  applications on a fly of right click.I created this because I had seen a common problem for registering dll files. Every time you need to open command prompt and type regsvr32.exe for every dll.
after using this application you can associate any file with any application and that will work if the application supports that file type . You just need to right click ober the file name and you will get the name which you have placed to appear in the right menu.Click and Voila U have done it.
So use application like this:: fill these in the text boxes 
.dll
regsvr32 (for registering) and regsvr32/U (for unregistering)
"Register" --? It can be any name and it will appear if you will right click on the .dll file 
Thats enough, I think if you still can't understand then leave this code .....  check out the screenshots
